# Case-Simulation-Valuation
Monte Carlo simulation in the context of interest rate financial engineering. Case and numbers are fictional and for illustration purposes only.

## Requirements
No special library or installation needed.

## Techniques used in valuation process
`Monte Carlo` simulation for the evolution of interest rate path. No variance reduction.

Interest rate path is assumed to follow the Hull-White Brownian Motion interest rate model.

Model parameters calibration using squared difference.

Basic data visualization with `matplotlib`.
